<h4>General</h4>

<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not
give rise to personal jurisdiction over WikiGrads, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall
be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph, any claim or dispute arising in connection with
the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California, and you consent
to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>


<p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought
is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.
The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR")
provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party
initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>These Terms, together with any amendments and additional agreements you may enter into with WikiGrads in connection with the Service,
shall constitute the entire agreement between you and WikiGrads concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions
of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between WikiGrads
and you regarding the Service.</p>

<p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and WikiGrads’
failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by WikiGrads
without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

<p>Please contact us at feedback@wikigrads.com with any questions regarding these Terms.</p>
