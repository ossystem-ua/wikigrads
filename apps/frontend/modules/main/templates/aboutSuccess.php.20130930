        <h1>Passive versus Active Learning</h1>
        <p>Passive lecturing is a mode of teaching used by most instructors at the college level. In this style of teaching, students play a non-active role in the classroom setting as they learn. Typically, the professor presents the material through lecture or visual presentation while students listen and take notes on the given information.</p>
        <p>Issues with passive learning arise when students are not engaged in the lecture material. Lack of engagement prevents the development of critical thinking and problem solving abilities. While this is in no way the fault of the professor, it does affect both the quantity and quality of education.</p>
        <p>Interactive learning, on the other hand, increases the quality of education because the material can be applied through critical thinking. Active learning gives students a chance to have dialogue with others. It also provides them the opportunity to think about the information on their own because they are actively participating in the learning process. “Hands on” discussions help information make the transition to long-term memory. Since passive learning has no two-way exchange, some cannot successfully retain the information. </p>

        <h1>Social Networking Supports Active Learning</h1>
        <p>Students and faculty alike have had their world defined by the Internet for more than a decade. The proliferation of digital, social and mobile technologies has created a culture in which we participate more in creating and sharing content. As a result, the way we communicate, interact, and learn has profoundly changed. In today’s world, students are accustomed to an interactive society. At the core of this transformation are social networking technologies, such as Facebook and Twitter, which are blurring the lines between our professional, personal, and academic lives.</p>
        <p>Unlike Facebook and Twitter, niche social networks are valuable because of their ability to build committed communities where individuals support each other in the pursuit of common goals. Academically-organized social networking technologies can complement the lecture and help engage a student’s interest, attention, and level of interaction. These student-centered and instructor-facilitated communities are available synchronous or asynchronous, via any location, and through the use of mobile and non-mobile devices. </p>

        <h1>Help Reform Higher Education!</h1>
        <p>Current topics of postsecondary debate include accountability-driven questions about the cost and quality of higher education. Furthermore, there is a broad consensus that the long-term key to continued U.S. competitiveness in a global economy is the adequacy of supply and quality of the workforce; student retention and postsecondary completion have recently emerged as leading concerns of the Obama Administration, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Lumina Foundation.</p>
        <p>The productivity and efficiency prospects offered by the information-technology revolution have exciting potential to help reform higher education. Most universities, however, view Web 2.0 technologies in education as simply curriculum-delivery devices. The widely-used course or learning management systems are great tools to help instructors deliver course announcements and links to course resources, as well as to organize grades and assignments. Unfortunately, <strong>learning management systems do not encourage student engagement or active learning.</strong></p>
        <p>Very few instructors have adopted social media to create engaging online environments to complement their lecture because the main social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are primarily used as non-academic social tools. WikiGrads is a social learning platform that provides active discussion/Q & A forums for university courses, individually and in groups. Complementation of online forums driven by social networking technologies with traditional lectures promises to increase the quality of the learning experience and student engagement, thereby improving student retention and success.</p>

        <h1>About the Founder</h1>
        <p>Lucas DeMaio received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State University. After completion of his graduate studies, Dr. DeMaio became a member of research staff in the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. He has published manuscripts in leading peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals. During his graduate and postdoctoral studies, Dr. DeMaio taught and mentored several undergraduate students. While most of his students successfully obtained their degrees, he began to notice that many of the students who dropped out of school lacked social engagement with other students and their instructors. WikiGrads was born from the observation that the most important factor for student success is positive interaction with a peer group on campus.</p>

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>WikiGrads is a free social learning platform, enabling students in higher education to more effectively engage, collaborate, and learn. The platform supplements and enhances traditional lectures by providing an interactive and student-centered environment that structures and drives academic engagement and active learning. </p>
        <p>Numerous studies have shown that active learning results in deeper learning, understanding, and transfer of knowledge. Active learning typically increases the quality of education because the material can be applied through critical thinking. Active learning gives students a chance to have dialogue with others. It also provides them the opportunity to think about the information on their own because they are actively participating in the learning process. “Hands on” discussions help information make the transition to long-term memory.</p>
        <p>Few instructors have adopted social media to create interactive learning environments to supplement their lecture because the main platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are primarily used as non-academic tools. Nonetheless, when social media interfaces are used in academics, studies have shown that learning experiences become more robust.</p>
        
        <h1>WikiGrads Supports a Collaborative Atmosphere that Benefits Instructors and Students</h1>
        <p>The traditional lecture is an efficient way to deliver course material but use of the lecture as the only mode of instruction presents problems for both instructors and students. Because passive learning from lectures has no two-way exchange, some students cannot successfully retain the information. The WikiGrads platform has been designed to enhance lectures, increase teaching effectiveness, and extend the learning experience beyond the physical bricks-and-mortar model.</p>
        <p>All questions and discussions on the platform are posted in one location, eliminating redundancy in instructor-student communications. The platform supplements traditional lectures by encouraging peer mentoring and student engagement anytime, anywhere. WikiGrads also benefits students who are not comfortable asking questions and interacting in a traditional classroom setting. Learning environments with a social media interface show great potential to minimize students’ fear of vulnerability, allowing them to more freely admit their struggles to peers and instructors.</p>

        <h1>WikiGrads: A Formative Assessment Tool for Instructors and Students</h1>
        <p>The features and benefits of social media interfaces in active learning are very similar to the literature on formative assessment. The importance of formative assessment in student learning is widely acknowledged, but it is not well understood across higher education. The goal of formative assessment is to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching and by students to improve their learning. Formative assessments are qualitative, considered part of the learning, and are not graded like summative assessments (midterms or final exams). More specifically, formative assessments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and target areas that need work</li>
            <li>Help instructors recognize where students are struggling and address problems immediately</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The WikiGrads platform easily enables instructors and teaching assistants to take a facilitating role in student learning, helping students construct an understanding but not develop the concept for them.</p>
        <p>Active learning and formative assessment methods go hand-in-hand. Despite clear evidence that they improve student learning and the quality of education, most instructors continue to use the traditional lecture as their only mode of teaching, in part because many instructors mistrust new pedagogical movements, or simply have little time to adopt new methodologies in teaching.</p>
        <p>The use of social media to improve student learning, teaching effectiveness and efficiency represents a powerful, yet largely untapped solution. The WikiGrads platform uses a simple and intuitive social interface that has been specifically designed to supplement lectures and encourage active learning and peer mentoring. This collaborative environment helps eliminate redundancy in instructor-student communications and magnifies the instructor’s teaching efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
