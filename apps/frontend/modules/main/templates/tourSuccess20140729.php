                <p>WikiGrads complements your lecture using technology that supports flexible, creative, 
                    and inclusive pedagogy.</p>

                <h2 class="slide-title">Publish multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks (NRD 2012)</h2>
                <p>Share handouts, artifacts (images, charts, graphs), or links to web pages/video to 
                    generate collaborative discussion or enhance understanding. Engage learners in 
                    challending tasks with supportive guidance and feedback.</p>

                <h2 class="slide-title">Share and discuss individual or collaborative assignments</h2>
                <p>Encourage  elaboration,  questioning, and self-explanation (NRC 2012). Exposing 
                    students to the work of peers stimulates new ways of thinking about topics, and 
                    refines understanding. Oversee and guide students through the peer review process. 
                    Students practice writing clearly and critically, and gain confidence in their 
                    intellectual abilities.</p>

                <h2 class="slide-title">Leverage high-enrollment numbers and social technology to drive reciprocity and cooperation</h2>
                <p>The use of familiar social media technology facilitates "spontaneous" peer 
                    mentoring and active learning with minimal instructor participation. 
                    Pin a post at the top of your page encouraging students to discuss homework 
                    questions, exchange ideas, and solve problems together. Become a facilitator 
                    of learning, and enjoy seeing students become active participants in the 
                    learning process!</p>

                <p>Social, multimedia learning environments are more engaging than discussion boards. 
                    Students interact with peers they may have never met or never will meet in person!</p>

                <p>To quickly spot instructor or student-generated content, names and endorsements 
                    are color-coded orange and blue, respectively.</p>

                <p>Students accumulate participation points and earn badges for asking or answering 
                    questions or sharing media.</p>
