    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>WikiGrads is a free social learning platform, enabling students in higher education to more effectively engage, collaborate, and learn. The platform supplements and enhances traditional lectures by providing an interactive and student-centered environment that structures and drives academic engagement and active learning. </p>

        <h3>Our Mission Is to Help Improve the Quality of Education that Institutions of Higher Education Deliver by Providing a Free Platform that Facilitates Peer Mentoring and Active Learning</h3>
        <p>Numerous studies have shown that active learning results in deeper learning, understanding, and transfer of knowledge. Active learning typically increases the quality of education because the material can be applied through critical thinking. Active learning gives students a chance to have dialogue with others. It also provides them the opportunity to think about the information on their own because they are actively participating in the learning process. “Hands on” discussions help information make the transition to long-term memory.</p>
        <p>Few instructors have adopted social media to create interactive learning environments to supplement their lecture because the main platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are primarily used as non-academic tools. Nonetheless, when social media interfaces are used in academics, studies have shown that learning experiences become more robust.</p>
        
        <h3>WikiGrads Supports a Collaborative Atmosphere that Benefits Instructors and Students</h3>
        <p>The traditional lecture is an efficient way to deliver course material but use of the lecture as the only mode of instruction presents problems for both instructors and students. Because passive learning from lectures has no two-way exchange, some students cannot successfully retain the information. The WikiGrads platform has been designed to enhance lectures, increase teaching effectiveness, and extend the learning experience beyond the physical bricks-and-mortar model.</p>
        <p>All questions and discussions on the platform are posted in one location, eliminating redundancy in instructor-student communications. The platform supplements traditional lectures by encouraging peer mentoring and student engagement anytime, anywhere. WikiGrads also benefits students who are not comfortable asking questions and interacting in a traditional classroom setting. Learning environments with a social media interface show great potential to minimize students’ fear of vulnerability, allowing them to more freely admit their struggles to peers and instructors.</p>

        <h3>WikiGrads: A Formative Assessment Tool for Instructors and Students</h3>
        <p>The features and benefits of social media interfaces in active learning are very similar to the literature on formative assessment. The importance of formative assessment in student learning is widely acknowledged, but it is not well understood across higher education. The goal of formative assessment is to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback that can be used by instructors to improve their teaching and by students to improve their learning. Formative assessments are qualitative, considered part of the learning, and are not graded like summative assessments (midterms or final exams). More specifically, formative assessments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and target areas that need work</li>
            <li>Help instructors recognize where students are struggling and address problems immediately</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The WikiGrads platform easily enables instructors and teaching assistants to take a facilitating role in student learning, helping students construct an understanding but not develop the concept for them.</p>
        <p>Active learning and formative assessment methods go hand-in-hand. Despite clear evidence that they improve student learning and the quality of education, many instructors use the traditional lecture as their only mode of teaching, in part because they simply have little time to adopt new methodologies in teaching. Collaborative learning environments with a social interface promise to increase student learning, eliminate redundancy in instructor-student communications while, at the same time, increasing teaching effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

        <h3>About the Founder</h3>
        <p>Lucas DeMaio, received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State University. After completion of his graduate studies, Dr. DeMaio became a member of research staff in the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. He has published manuscripts in leading peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals. During his graduate and postdoctoral studies, Dr. DeMaio taught and mentored undergraduate students. While most of his students successfully obtained their degrees, he began to notice that many of the students who dropped out of school lacked social engagement with other students and their instructors. WikiGrads was born from the observation that the most important factor for student success is positive interaction with peers and instructors.</p>
