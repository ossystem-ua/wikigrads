<h1>Our Mission:  To Build An Active Learning Platform To Complement Lectures and Increase Engagement</h1>

<p>WikiGrads is a prototype social academic network, enabling students in higher education to more effectively connect, collaborate, and learn.  The free platform generates a personalized learning environment for each user, which integrates social networking features and a modern stream-based architecture.  Students are connected with classmates, instructors, and their peers from other institutions who are studying the same subject.  This innovative social networking technology provides an active learning platform to complement traditional lectures, making it easier for students to learn with and from each other.  By connecting students with classmates or peers across multiple institutions, our vision is to become an effective network that enhances student participation, engagement, and success.</p>

<p>Passive lecturing is a mode of teaching used by many instructors in higher education.  In this style of teaching, it is common for students to play a non-active role in the classroom.  Issues with passive learning arise when students are not engaged in the lecture material.  Lack of engagement prevents the development of critical thinking and problem solving abilities.  While this is in no way the fault of the professor, it does affect both the quantity and quality of education.</p>

<p>Active learning typically increases the quality of education because the material can be applied through critical thinking.  Active learning gives students a chance to have dialogue with others.  It also provides them the opportunity to think about the information on their own because they are actively participating in the learning process.  “Hands on” discussions help information make the transition to long-term memory.  Since passive learning has no two-way exchange, some cannot successfully retain the information.</p>

<p>Social media has now become an integral part of our lives, and no group feels its impact more than students.  Very few instructors have adopted social media to create engaging online environments to complement their lecture because the main social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are primarily used as non-academic social tools.  Nonetheless, many educators understand that academia needs to learn how to effectively exploit the engaging features of social media for educational purposes.  When social media is integrated with academics, studies have shown significant positive impact on student learning.</p>

<p>Most higher education institutions view Web 2.0 technologies in education as simply curriculum-delivery devices.  The widely used Learning Management Systems (LMS) are useful tools to deliver course announcements and links to course resources, as well as organize grades and assignments.  However, LMS are not social and do not encourage engagement or active learning.</p>

<p>At WikiGrads, our mission is to improve the quality of the academic experience that institutions of higher education deliver, by innovatively applying social media and internet-based technologies that structure and drive academic engagement.  This approach supplements passive learning from traditional lectures and extends the learning experience beyond the physical bricks-and-mortar model.</p>

<h1>About the Founder</h1>

<p>Lucas DeMaio, received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State University.  After completion of his graduate studies, Dr. DeMaio became a member of research staff in the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.  He has published manuscripts in leading peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals.  During his graduate and postdoctoral studies, Dr. DeMaio taught and mentored undergraduate students.  While most of his students successfully obtained their degrees, he began to notice that many of the students who dropped out of school lacked social engagement with other students and their instructors.  WikiGrads was born from the observation that the most important factor for student success is positive interaction with a peer group on campus.</p>
